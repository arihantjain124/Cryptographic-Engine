# Cryptographic-Engine
This is a C program that encrypts or decrypts files by using I/O file stream in C.

This Program works by opening the file you chose in binary format using I/O file stream in C and changing its content in binary making it corrupted and inaccessible to anyone.
As it works in binary mode it can work on any format of file such as docx,mp4,exe,txt,etc.

It Encrypts the data of the files according to the alphanumeric key you enter during ecryption.
To decrypt the data use the same alphanumeric key you used during encryption.
