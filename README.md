# Cryptographic-Engine
Program that encrypts or decrypts files using I/O file stream in C.

It works by opening the file you chose in binary format using I/O file stream in C and changing its content in binary mode making it corrupted and inaccessible to anyone. As it works in binary mode it can work on any format of file such as docx,mp4,exe,txt,etc.

It encrypts the data of the files according to the alphanumeric key you enter during ecryption.
To decrypt the data use the same alphanumeric key you used during encryption.

The loading fuctions are independent to the encrpytion mechanic.
